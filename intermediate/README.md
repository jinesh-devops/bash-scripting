# Intermediate Level Bash Scripting

This folder contains practical Bash automation scripts commonly used in daily DevOps / Linux Admin / SRE operational work.  
These scripts move beyond fundamentals and start focusing on real environment observability, monitoring, alerting and system troubleshooting.

| directory_backup.sh         | Creates directory backup and stores compressed archive                                  |

### Capabilities Developed at Intermediate Level

- Linux OS operations automation
- Monitoring + alert style bash scripting
- System troubleshooting automation logic
- Error/Log pattern parsing
- Backup handling automation
- Threshold based alert scripting techniques

### Why this level matters?

This level builds the transition layer from pure logic scripts → into real operational DevOps automation & SRE workflows.  
This prepares for **advanced level integrations** with AWS / Docker / Kubernetes / Cloud Security etc.
