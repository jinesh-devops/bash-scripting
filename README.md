Bash Scripting – DevOps Automation Portfolio

This repo demonstrates hands-on DevOps engineering capability via automation driven problem solving using pure Bash scripting.

This repository contains complete end-to-end Bash scripting automation examples used in real DevOps, Cloud, Security, SRE & Platform Engineering environments.
Each folder is structured in progressive learning order → Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Real DevOps Use Cases → Interview Questions.

Why this repository?

In real industry DevOps tasks, Bash scripting is still the backbone glue automation between AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD, Monitoring, Security and Linux OS operations.
This repository showcases strong Bash capability with integrations into Cloud & DevOps platforms — purely through real problem solving scripts.
