# Beginner Level Bash Scripting

This folder contains basic Bash scripting examples that help build strong fundamentals required before moving into real DevOps automation and platform scripting.

These scripts focus on logic building, conditions, loops, file checks, math operations, decision making and core bash syntax understanding.
